Title: Basic setup
----

In this chapter you will read about using translation interface.

Setup
=====

Firstly you should configure Opl_Loader and create Opt_Class object. Then we can
configure our Opc_Translate.

~~~~
[php]
<?php
// code before is setting up Opl_Loader
$tpl = new Opt_Class; // 1
$adapter = new Opc_Translate_Adapter_Ini('./langs/'); // 2
$t = new Opc_Translate($adapter); // 3
$tpl->setTranslationInterface($t); // 4
~~~~

> [steps]
> 1. We create Opt_Class object.
> 2. Now we have to create at least one adapter for Opc_Translate. Adapters loads language files from format you have selected.
> 3. Here we create Opc_Translate object. Its constructor needs to have default adapter - adapter witch it will use for all operations.
> 4. And at last we registers translation interface to OPT.

And that's basic configuration. It uses default language - of course English.
