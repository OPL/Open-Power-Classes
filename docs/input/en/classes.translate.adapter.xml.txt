How to set options to adapter?
==============================

We have 2 ways of setting options to adapter.

First
-----

We could use array use it while constructing new object.

~~~~
[php]
$options = array('directory' => './langs/', 'fileExistsCheck' => false); // 1
$adapter = new Opc_Translate_Adapter_Xml($options); // 2
~~~~

> [steps]
> 1. Our options array.
> 2. Using it while constructing new object.

Second
------

We could use setters for every option.

~~~~
[php]
$adapter = new Opc_Translate_Adapter_Xml();
$adapter->setDirectory('./langs/');
$adapter->setFileExistsCheck(false);
~~~~

As you can see, all setters have exactly the same name as configuration option.
Remember just to set at least all required options.

It is possible to get states of features just by replacing `set` by `get` in these methods.
