Title: Setup

----

Installation
============

At the begining you should know that DoctrineModels should be registered AFTER Opl_Loader.
So your code should look like this:

~~~~
[php]
<?php
require('./libs/Opl/Base.php');
Opl_Loader::setDirectory('./libs/');
Opl_Loader::register();

// You have setup Opl_Loader now.

Opc_DoctrineModels::setPath('./models/'); // 1
Opc_DoctrineModels::register(); // 2
~~~~

> [steps]
> 1. We set path to models directory. The path should end with `/`, but it is not necessary like in Opl_Loader.
> 2. Now we register an autoloader.

Using
=====

If you configured it like it is shown above - you can use your models without thinking about loading it.
Autoloader loads it automatically, of course it is lazy loading.
